# testgrunt_b

Basic structure for a web app:

  HTML,
  SASS as CSS preprocessor,
  JS
  
  Grunt is used to automate tasks, at the moment:

  - combining all scss files into one css file for distribution
  - combining (concatenating) all js files into one js file "production.js" for distribution
  - minifying (uglify) production.js to "production.min.js"

At the moment is working for me...
